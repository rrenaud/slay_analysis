Welcome to the Slay the Spire data analysis project.  This is currently
limited to Defect games, because it's still young and they are the character
that I play best.

This requires the Monthly_20_10 and Monthly_2020_11 datasets from here to
be extracted in a raw_logs subdirectory. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c7MwTdLxnPgvmPbBEfNWa45YAUU53H0l .  Run the log_preprocessor.py to generate
the game logs with per fight deck info.  Then open the slay_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter.

A list of ideas for the project are here:

If you want to contribute, I hang out in #data-analysis in the Slay the Spire discord.
